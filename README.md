# JavaScript Loose Equality and Null Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (`==`) and the handling of `null` values.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## The Problem

Loose equality (`==`) in JavaScript performs type coercion, which can lead to unexpected results when comparing values. This is particularly problematic when dealing with `null`.  The original code does not explicitly check for `null` values, leading to potential errors.

## The Solution

The solution explicitly checks for `null` values before performing any other operations. This prevents unexpected behavior and improves code reliability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` and observe the output.
3. Run `bugSolution.js` and compare the output.
